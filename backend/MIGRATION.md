## How to Run

### Option 1: Run Separately (Recommended for Development)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd "c:\Users\SAMEER\Desktop\Backend projects\Posting App"
npm start
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd "c:\Users\SAMEER\Desktop\Backend projects\Posting App\frontend"
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Install concurrently (Optional)
For running both servers with one command, you can install `concurrently`:

```bash
npm install -g concurrently
```

Then from the root directory:
```bash
concurrently "npm start" "cd frontend && npm run dev"
```

## What's Different?

### Before (EJS):
- Server-side rendering with EJS templates
- Form submissions with page redirects
- Session-based state management
- Monolithic architecture

### After (React):
- Client-side rendering with React
- API-based communication with JSON
- JWT token authentication
- Separated frontend/backend architecture
- Better scalability and maintainability

## API Endpoints Created

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`:

**Authentication:**
- POST `/api/register`
- POST `/api/login`
- POST `/api/logout`
- GET `/api/check-auth`

**User:**
- GET `/api/profile`
- POST `/api/upload`

**Posts:**
- POST `/api/post`
- GET `/api/post/:id`
- PUT `/api/post/:id`
- DELETE `/api/post/:id`
- POST `/api/like/:id`

## Features Preserved

✅ User registration and authentication
✅ Profile picture upload
✅ Create posts
✅ Edit posts
✅ Like/Unlike posts
✅ User profile dashboard
✅ Same UI design (Tailwind CSS)

## New Features Added

✨ Protected routes with proper auth checking
✨ Better error handling and user feedback
✨ Loading states for better UX
✨ API-first architecture (can be used with mobile apps)
✨ Proper separation of concerns

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start MongoDB
- [ ] Start backend server (port 3000)
- [ ] Start frontend server (port 5173)
- [ ] Register a new user
- [ ] Login with credentials
- [ ] Create a post
- [ ] Like a post
- [ ] Edit a post
- [ ] Upload profile picture
- [ ] Logout

## Next Steps

1. Review the README.md for detailed documentation
2. Check QUICKSTART.md for simple running instructions
3. Test all features to ensure everything works
4. Consider adding environment variables for configuration
5. Deploy backend and frontend separately for production

## Notes

- The old EJS views are still in the `views/` folder but are no longer used
- You can safely delete the `views/` folder if desired
- The `public/` folder is still used for serving uploaded images
- Frontend proxies API calls through Vite dev server

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the README.md troubleshooting section
2. Verify MongoDB is running
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify both servers are running
5. Check network tab for API call failures
